# OpenFN

## Summary&#x20;

OpenFn is an integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) and a suite of open source extract, transform, and load, data-integration, and interoperability tools used to automate workflows and the exchange of information across and within systems in a secure, stable, and scalable manner. &#x20;

## Health Verticals and Applications

Organizations worldwide use OpenFn to integrate health information and automate service delivery applications. OpenFn solutions strengthen existing health digital systems through automated data integration, data cleaning, and reporting pipelines. &#x20;

OpenFn has been implemented by governments and nongovernmental organizations to:&#x20;

* Synchronize data between mobile phones and a central management information system so community health workers have up-to-date access to patient data.&#x20;
* Pay individuals via mobile money (e.g., M-PESA) transactions when certain conditions are met in a management or human resources system.&#x20;
* Send referrals and sensitive case data between service providers that use distinct systems.&#x20;
* Receive community health worker visit data in real time from a mobile app and load it into DHIS2.&#x20;
* Reformat patient data to adhere to standards (e.g., Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources \[HL7 FHIR]) before automatically loading it into a health information mediator.&#x20;
* Automate data cleaning and duplicate-checking processes in reporting pipelines.&#x20;
* Sync financial systems with program management systems.
* Send SMS messages to field workers, automatically detecting and notifying them of critical changes to various systems or processes. &#x20;
* Summarize and aggregate monitoring data to automatically report across key health indicators.&#x20;

## Interoperability&#x20;

OpenFn (the iPaaS), OpenFn/core, OpenFn/    microservice, and more than 60 open source adaptors maintained by OpenFn can be used locally or on the cloud, and as stand-alone solutions or as modules in other applications. Together the interoperability suite provides organizations with the tools they need to connect with any application or database, adhere to any data standard, and automate any routine digital process. These tools range from lightweight Node.js apps to robust and highly fault-tolerant enterprise applications running on the Erlang VM. The tools are typically used in their hosted forms on the cloud or deployed with Docker and/or Kubernetes.&#x20;

## Geographic Coverage&#x20;

Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Finland, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, United States, Vietnam, Zimbabwe.&#x20;

## COVID-19 Response&#x20;

For COVID-19 response, OpenFn implementations are adjusted to connect online and offline community health worker tools with cloud-based health information systems, facilitating better disease surveillance. For COVID-19 vaccine support, OpenFn implementations are configured to connect vaccine eligibility, request, and delivery data across systems and to facilitate the transfer of vaccine-related supply chain data between systems.&#x20;

## Impact snapshot

As of November 2021, OpenFn receives and processes 2.4 million messages (requests from external systems) every year. In addition, it runs more than a thousand different jobs (integration scripts) 2.6 million times every year. Also, it has more than 60 adaptors for the most used tools across the ICT4D sector and is used by more than 40 governments and nongovernmental organizations across 38 countries.
